Hello

1. Download XAMPP and start apache and mysql

2. Extract the project archive and copy the pxl folder to:
localdrive/xampp/htdocs/

3. Import the database:
Go to : localhost/phpmyadmin
Go to Import, then click on browse and select the database
file in the database folder, and scroll down and import

4. Go to : localhost/pxl/admin
email: info@dedevelopers.com
password: 1234abcd

Note 1 :

The excel sheet cells data must ordered like so:
Title in cell A
Price in cell B
Image link in cell C
Description in cell D

If the title already exists, the product row will be ignored.
If the cell C does not contain a valid image link, the product row will 
be ignored.

Note 2 :

I have edited the config files (database and config) in order to
work on local cumputer.

In order to work on production server, copy both database and config
files that are in the old config files to : application/config/

Thank you
